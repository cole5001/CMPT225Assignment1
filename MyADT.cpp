/*
 * MyADT.cpp
 * 
 * Class Description: A linear data collection ADT.
 * 
 * Class Invariant: Data collection with the following characteristics:
 *                  - This is a value-oriented data collection and 
 *                    the elements are kept in ascending sort order of search key.
 *                  - Each element is unique (no duplicates). 
 *                  - Its data structure (CDT) is not expandable. This signifies that 
 *                    when this data collection becomes full, you do not have to resize 
 *                    its data structure (not in this Assignment 1).
